### P1 概述

**Small-world networks** provide an appealing description of **cortical architecture** owing to their capacity for **integration and segregation** combined with an economy of **connectivity**. 

Previous reports of low-density interareal graphs and apparent small-world properties are challenged by data that reveal **high-density cortical graphs** in which economy of connections is achieved by **weight heterogeneity** and **distance-weight correlations**. 以往的皮层低密度图已更新为高密度图模型，其中连接是否经济用加权的异质性？和连接的距离加权表示。

These properties define a model that predicts many **binary and weighted features** of the cortical network including a **core-periphery**, a typical feature of self-organizing information processing systems. 基于这些性质做出的模型可以预测很多皮层网络的二元加权特性，比如中心-边缘特性，一种典型的自组织的信息处理系统。

Feedback and feed-forward pathways between areas exhibit a **dual counterstream organization**, and their integration into local circuits constrains cortical computation. 区域之间的反馈和前馈路径展现出一种双向逆流结构，这些结构与附近环路的集成限制了皮层的计算能力。

Here, we propose a **bow-tie representation** of interareal architecture derived from the hierarchical laminar weights of pathways between the high-efficiency dense core and periphery.我们提出了领结模型，展示了从高效核心区域到边缘区域的加权分层路径形成的跨区域结构。
