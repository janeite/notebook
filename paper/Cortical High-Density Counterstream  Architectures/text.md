### Abstract

**Small-world networks** provide an appealing description of **cortical architecture** owing to their capacity for **integration and segregation** combined with an economy of **connectivity**. 

Previous reports of low-density interareal graphs and apparent small-world properties are challenged by data that reveal **high-density cortical graphs** in which economy of connections is achieved by **weight heterogeneity** and **distance-weight correlations**. 以往的皮层低密度图已更新为高密度图模型，其中连接是否经济用加权的异质性？和连接的距离加权表示。

These properties define a model that predicts many **binary and weighted features** of the cortical network including a **core-periphery**, a typical feature of self-organizing information processing systems. 基于这些性质做出的模型可以预测很多皮层网络的二元加权特性，比如中心-边缘特性，一种典型的自组织的信息处理系统。

Feedback and feed-forward pathways between areas exhibit a **dual counterstream organization**, and their integration into local circuits constrains cortical computation. 区域之间的反馈和前馈路径展现出一种双向逆流结构，这些结构与附近环路的集成限制了皮层的计算能力。

Here, we propose a **bow-tie representation** of interareal architecture derived from the hierarchical laminar weights of pathways between the high-efficiency dense core and periphery.我们提出了领结模型，展示了从高效核心区域到边缘区域的加权分层路径形成的跨区域结构。

Because the concepts of **localization of function** and **parcellation into cortical areas** are closely intertwined, elucidating the global pattern of areal interactions is central to understanding higher brain functions (1–5). 因为功能分区和脑区分割的概念是交织在一起的，所以搞清楚区域之间相互作用的模式对理解高级大脑功能至关重要。

Cerebral cortex in the macaque monkey is subdivided into a mosaic of ~100 cortical areas, each displaying characteristic features, including cytoarchitecture (6). 猴脑皮层已经被分割成一百多块具有不同特征的小区域

Each area has a characteristic connectivity profile thought to contribute to determining its functional properties (1,7,8). 每块区域为了实现其功能，形成了独特的连接模式。

Here, we review how interareal connectivity at the single-cell level (9), revealed by quantitative anatomical tract tracing, is relevant to our understanding of large-scale cortical networks and their hierarchical organization (8,10–13).由解剖得到的追踪剂定量研究结果得到的单细胞层面的跨区域连接模式，对理解大尺度皮层网络及其层级结构是相关的。

The circuitry of cerebral cortex is dominated by local (within-area) connections, and interareal connections constitute only about 20% of total cortical connectivity. Hence, the dozens of long-distance projections to areas beyond the immediate neighboring areas account for ~ 5% (10). 大脑皮层的大部分连接都是区域内的，跨区域连接只占皮层总连接量的20%，除了直接相邻区域以外的远距离连接只占5%。

Local networks conform in many ways to a canonical **microcircuit** that spans all cortical layers (14,15) and includes recurrent excitation presumed to shape and amplify the sparse input from subcortical and distant cortical sources (16).区域内连接从各个角度都符合一个典型的微电路？模型，它跨越皮层的所有层次，可以反复激发，以便生成和放大从皮层下和远处皮层传来的微弱信号。

Felleman and V an Essen (FVE) showed that interareal connectivity obeys hierarchical constraints rooted in the strong anatomical regularities of feedforward and feedback pathways (17). In this way, multiple distributed cortical hierarchies form a large-scale model of the cortex (17) that reflects the laminar integration of interareal connectivity into local circuits (18) and is relevant to sensory (17,19,20), motor (21,22), and cognitive (23–27) systems. The structural features of interareal interactions may provide important insights into the observed dynamics of large-scale interareal networks controlling information flow through the cortex (1,28,29).
