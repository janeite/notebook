review summary
### Background: 
The cerebral cortex is divisible into many individual areas, each exhibiting distinct connectivity profiles, architecture, and physiological characteristics. 

Interactions among cortical areas underlie higher sensory, motor, and cognitive functions. 

Graph theory provides an important framework for understanding network properties of the interareal weighted and directed connectivity matrix reported in recent studies.
### Advances: 
We derive an **exponential distance rule** that predicts many binary and weighted features of the cortical network, including 
1. efficiency of information transfer, 
2. the high specificity of long-distance compared to short-distance connections, 
3. wire length minimization, and 
4. the existence of a highly interconnected cortical core. 

We propose a **bow-tie representation** of the cortex, which combines these features with hierarchical processing.
### Outlook: 
The exponential distance rule has important implications for understanding scaling properties of the cortex and developing future large-scale dynamic models of the cortex.
